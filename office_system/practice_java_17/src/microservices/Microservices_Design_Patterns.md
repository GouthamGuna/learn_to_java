# Microservices design patterns follow several principles, as you can see in this list.

	Independent and autonomous services– This refers to the fact that each service is able to work independently of other services. They can also be 		deployed independently..

	Scalability– Microservices are able to scale their specs on demand. This architecture is able to administer resources where and when they are 	required.

	Decentralization– Microservices adopt decentralization, and this enables the team of developers to build and deploy the code in a smoother manner. 	Decentralized architecture also means that there is no central point of failure.

	Resilience– This architecture also ensures that the app is resilient to failure and able to restart on another machine. The interconnectivity that 	would 	normally cause issues in monolithic architecture can easily be avoided in a microservice architecture.

	Real-time load balancing– Load balancing refers to the way a system efficiently distributes incoming traffic across a group of backend servers. Microservices 	use two types of load-balancing architecture, and these are server-side load balancing and client-side load balancing.

	Availability– High availability systems are able to provide continuous service to the client. All hosts in the system must point to the same storage. The 	microservice has to be available for function even if there is a failure.

	Continuous delivery through DevOps Integration– This is the automation of the building, testing, configuring, and deploying of code. The developers regularly 	merge their code changes to a central repository, and then they run the build and test processes.

	Seamless API Integration and Continuous Monitoring– This helps to bring visibility into the performance, availability, and functional correctness of the 	system. It involves collecting and analyzing data about the performance of the API.

	Isolation from Failures– With this architecture, the application will be able to keep running, even if one service crashes.
	Auto-provisioning– Every service in the microservice application is self-sufficient and runs within its own container.
