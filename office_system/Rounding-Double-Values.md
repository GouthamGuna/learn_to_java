# Rounding-double-values-with-2-decimal-places in java

 Rounding a double value to two decimal places in Java can be achieved using various methods. Here are a few approaches:

 1.Using `Math.round:`

    double originalValue = 1234.56789;
    double roundedValue = Math.round(originalValue * 100.0) / 100.0;

This method multiplies the original value by 100, rounds it to the nearest integer, and then divides it back by 100 to get the rounded value with two decimal places

 2.Using `BigDecimal:`

    BigDecimal originalValue = new BigDecimal("1234.56789");
    BigDecimal roundedValue = originalValue.setScale(2, RoundingMode.HALF_UP);

 This method creates a BigDecimal object from the original value, sets the scale to 2, and uses the HALF_UP rounding mode to round the value to two decimal places.

 3.Using `String.format:`

    double originalValue = 1234.56789;
    String roundedValue = String.format("%.2f", originalValue);

 This method uses the String.format method to format the original value as a string with two decimal places.

 4.Using `DecimalFormat:`

    double originalValue = 1234.56789;
    DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat("#.##");
    String roundedValue = df.format(originalValue);
    double parsedValue = Double.parseDouble(roundedValue);

 This method creates a DecimalFormat object with the desired pattern and uses the format method to obtain the rounded representation as a string. The parsedValue variable can be used to get the rounded value as a double.

 Each method has its advantages and use cases, and the choice of method depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the project.
